        <h1>Serving static files over HTTP</h1>
        <p>This simple HTTP server can be used to serve static content. It is probably the best usecase for what it does.</p>
        <p>Because it can be embedded in any application and has a low memory footprint, it can be used as a local dev server.</p>
